                <br/><br/>
                Smart Tutor reserves the right to use your registration information for it's intended purpose, for instance posting a tutor's profile in public for attracting clients or sending it to prospective clients directly. Or, for instance, providing the contact number of a client to a tutor who has arrived at their doorstep. Nevertheless, your personal information would not be public. Such information as your name, password, telephone number, date of birth, etc. should not be public, as it is private one. For full information, look at our privacy policy.
                </p>
            
            <h2>4. Rates, Commission, and Payment</h2>
            <p>All currency references are in Singapore dollars (SGD). You shall be responsible for payment of all levies, duties or taxes that are imposed by taxing rules for any payment or fees you may collect through using our services.


                <br/><br/>
                Tuition rates listed on our website are merely guidelines. The exact price for tuition services may differ depending on client's requirements, market conditions, availability of tutors, etc. The tutors can establish rates by themselves. But the final decision concerning price shall be accepted by confirmed agreement of both parties via an official confirmation invoice sent by Smart Tutor.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                Clients shall pay the invoice and inform Smart Tutor within three days of the due date. It is the client's responsibility to ensure that the bank receipt is kept as proof of transaction made through cash deposit transfer.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                If the Client or Tutor has any outstanding amount owed to Smart Tutor, Smart Tutor will try its best to ask for payment via phone calls and sms messages. However, after 14 (fourteen) days, if the payment is not made, payment reminder letters shall be sent by mail. The account may also be referred to our lawyers for further recovery actions if settlement is still delayed despite payment letters sent. The debtor shall be liable to pay all costs (including administrative, solicitor and client costs incurred by Smart Tutor in demanding and enforcing payment of money due on your above account(s).
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                Tuition rates agreed upon should not be changed unless clients and tutors mutually agree. Smart Tutor reserves the right to claim its commission based on the original agreed upon tuition rate.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                In most cases, we will collect the conducted tuition fees directly from the client (sometimes, we also collect payment from tutor) and will then subsequently resolve any payment issues owing to the tutor. Thus, for cancelled tuition arrangements, clients are required to deal directly with the agency. If clients decide to pay the tutor directly and bypass the agency, clients shall be made liable to Smart Tutor for the commission amount if we fail to collect our commission from the tutor, in addition to any administrative fees incurred by the agency in collecting the fees.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                In general, tutors shall not collect the agency commission from the client directly. If they do so, they shall inform the agency immediately. At notice by the agency, they shall make payment to the agency in full within 3 days. Tutors, who fail to follow these instructions, shall be liable to pay the full amount of payment and additionally, administrative fees, incurred by the agency in collecting the payment from the tutor.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                Smart Tutor reserves the right to change commission due to non-fulfillment of tutor's obligations or other reasons. Clients are liable to pay tuition fees for all attended lessons, regardless of how satisfactory the lessons were. For more information – read the website.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                Refunds may be made to the client's bank account in case of violations of terms because of the tutor's fault, or other reasons. Client can be additionally charged for improper or unfulfilled payment obligation. Smart Tutor warns about this with messages.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                If there are disputes or concerns regarding tuition fees between tutors and clients, we will provide assistance, to our reasonable means, to help tutors to claim fees from clients and vice versa. However, Smart Tutor shall not be legally responsible for any payment disputes between tutors and clients. Clients shall inform the agency and the tutor (if the client has the tutor's contact) if a postponement or cancellation of any lesson is needed. If the tutor is only informed less than two hours away to the start time of the lesson, clients shall be liable to pay for the loss time and transport cost to the tutor. The amount payable will be 50% of 1 lesson. The client shall pay this amount in cash immediately on the tutor's next visit or via bank transfer to the tutor if there is no more next visit. Cancellations or postponement of lessons shall not affect our commission amount.</p>

            <h2>5. Essential provisions relating to the relationship between the client and the tutor</h2>
            <p>– The client may request a replacement tutor or cancel at any time after the first lesson, but will still have to pay the attended tuition fees to Smart Tutor.


                <br/><br/>
                -The tutoring period is usually stated clearly as we arrange the tuition assignment. In the event that the tutoring period is not specified, all parties should be prepared to commit for at least 3 months.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                -There is an unspoken agreement to complete minimum 1 lesson upon tutor confirmation. If clients decide to cancel after 1 or more lessons for any reason, only conducted lessons shall need to be paid for and Smart Tutor will refund any the remaining fees paid in advance. However, for cancellations before first lesson has even commenced, clients will be liable for administrative fees no less than the equivalent of the first lesson fees which must be paid by the due date specified in the invoice.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                -Clients shall inform the agency and the tutor (if the client has the tutor's contact) if a postponement or cancellation of any lesson is needed. If the tutor is only informed less than two hours away to the start time of the lesson, clients shall be liable to pay for the loss time and transport cost to the tutor. The amount payable will be 50% of 1 lesson. The client shall pay this amount in cash immediately on the tutor's next visit or via bank transfer to the tutor if there is no more next visit. Cancellations or postponement of lessons shall not affect our commission amount.
                
                
                <br/><br/>
                -The tuition schedule and the date and time of the first lesson shall be fixed and hold to. Clients are allowed to renegotiate the schedule with tutors. Any changes in the frequency of lessons in the first 4 weeks of lessons must be made known to Smart Tutor. Smart Tutor may adjust commission under such conditions.</p>

              <h2>6. Termination</h2>

                At the request of clients or tutors, we may need to specify gender or race preferences in the jobs or marketing messages we send out via various communication channels This is purely due to clients' or tutors' specified preferences and not the agency's initiative or intention.
