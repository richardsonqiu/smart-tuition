              </h2>
              <p>As a tuition agency, Smart Tutor is tasked with matching students and tutors. Hence, we may use Tutor's information as a form of advertisement on both our online and offline marketing collaterals (for example our website and social media). In doing so, details such as Tutor's First Name, Age, Profile Photo, Gender, Race, Teaching Preferences, Academic Qualifications, Preferred Tutoring Locations, Tutor Category and Teaching Experience may be revealed to the public.

                <br/><br/>
                Tutors have been informed on the tutor registration forms and are given the option to set their profile as private if they do not wish for their information to be used in any advertisements.
                </p>

              <h2>5. Geographic Information
              </h2>

                <br/><br/>
                -When a Tutee requests for proof of a tutor's certificates during the matching process, Smart Tutor will first seek the express consent from the Tutor before sending any files to the Tutee.
                
                <br/><br/>
                -Any communication between Tutor and Tutee prior to confirmation shall be made via conference call with Smart Tutor (personal data is not shared)

                -Only when an assignment is expressly confirmed by both the Tutee and Tutor, with a date to start the first meeting between the two parties, then we may send the phone number, email, and full address of the Tutee to the Tutor, and vice versa, for the purpose of liaison.
                
                <br/><br/>
                -If there are any disputes between Tutee and Tutor, Smart Tutor will not reveal personal information unless required by law.
